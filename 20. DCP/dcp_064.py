'''
similar to the N queens problem (#38) or the flight itinerary problem (#41). The basic idea is this:

For every possible square, initialize a knight there, and then:
Try every valid move from that square.
Once weâ€™ve hit every single square, we can add to our count.
'''

'''
This takes O(N * N) space and potentially O(8^(N^2)) time.
Since at each step we have potentially 8 moves to check,
and we have to do this for each square.
