# Bellman ford can find negative edges
# since our question ask us to find arbitrage with amount greater than original
# to get the edge path a -> b -> c -> d. Since we want to see if a * b * c * d > 1
# so to get the negative cycle, we can use log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b).
# take the negative log of each edge 
# -(log(a) + log(b) + log(c) + log(d)) = -log(a * b * c * d) = -log(x) < 0
# if x is greater than 1, so thatâ€™s why if we have a negative cost cycle, 
# if means that the product of the weighted edges is bigger than 1
