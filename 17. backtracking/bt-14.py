'''
Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix and an integer k, determine whether each node in the graph can be colored such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color using at most k colors.

'''
O(k^N) time and O(k) space, where N is the number of vertices, since weâ€™re iterating over k colors and we are backtracking over N vertices.
