'''
Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any overlapping of words. It is given that all words are of the same length.

Input: String="catfoxcat", Words=["cat", "fox"]
Output: [0, 3]
Explanation: The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".

1. Keep the frequency of every word in a HashMap.
2. Starting from every index in the string, try to match all the words.
3. In each iteration, keep track of all the words that we have already seen in another HashMap.
4. If a word is not found or has a higher frequency than required, we can move on to the next character in the string.
5. Store the index if we have found all the words.

time complexity O(N*M*Len) where `N` is the number of characters in the given string, `M` is the total number of words, and `Len` is the length of a word.
