Alien Dictionary (hard)
There is a "dictionary" containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the characters. Write a method to find the correct order of characters in the alien language.

Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
Output: bac
Explanation: Given that the words are "sorted lexicographically" by the rules of the alien language, so
from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
 
1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
 
From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
