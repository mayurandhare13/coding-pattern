Coin Change
Given an infinite supply of â€˜nâ€™ coin denominations and a total money amount, we are asked to find the total number of distinct ways to make up that amount.

Denominations: {1,2,3}
Total amount: 5
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five ways to make the change for '5', here are those ways:
{1,1,1,1,1} 
{1,1,1,2} 
{1,2,2}
{1,1,3}
{2,3}
