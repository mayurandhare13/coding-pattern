'''
Count of Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard) #

Given a number 'n', write a function to return the count of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that can store values 1 to 'n'.
Catalan number problem

Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There will be 5 unique BSTs that can store numbers from 1 to 5.

Estimated time complexity will be O(n*2^n) but the actual time complexity O(4^n/âˆšn) is bounded by the Catalan number
